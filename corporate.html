          <ul>
            <li>
              Our Visual identity fits with our vision and values because the colours we used are very calm, because we use warm nature tones. This can be linked to a safe environment. We want our users to feel comfortable enough to share their experiences. A calming colour pallet can help with this. Since the target audience enjoys camping and the outdoors, and the colour scheme matches their aesthetic, the colours also work for them. 
              
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #E09132;"></span>
                  #E09132
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #454230;"></span>
                  #454230
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The typography aligns with our vision and values because a blog allows people to share knowledge and experiences, but without a clear font, readers won't understand what you are writing about. Furthermore, the typography has a handwritten appearance, which improves and personalises the blog reading experience. Because of this, it appeals to our target audience. </li>
			<li>We want to give our community a cosy vibe with the future designs and aesthetics of our website. This has the potential to foster a sense of belonging and unity. And therefore aligns with our vision of coming together. The cosy vibe that comes with camping makes this aesthetic appealing to our target market as well. </li>
            <li>UI and UX</li>
			<p>When opening the website, the first thing you see is a big video and the navigation bar of course. The nav bar has a few functions on the website. When clicking on the name ‘campsite’ you always go to the home page. Because people don’t always know that, we wanted to make the UX easier to make a ‘home’ page with one of the headers as well. The pages are listed next to each other and it's clear there are 4 main pages since there is not more text. We decided to make use of text instead of icons, so it's clear in 1 word what the page is about which we cannot express in 1 icon in our case. 
The left side of the navigation bar has 2 functions. You have a search bar and next to that a chat function. We wanted to put this in the nav bar so the chat function is always accessible. 
</p>
			<p>On the whole website, we use a lot of videos and pictures. Our target group is 20-26, this target group is a lot on Tiktkok and Instagram. So everything has to be clear with one glance.  When you hover over for example a video, it starts playing, which increases the UI. When you hover over an image or for example a blog, a slight shadow appears, so that it's clear when you click on it, it will lead you to something else.</p>
			<p>On top of that, throughout the website we made use of different buttons. (fe. the search button and the login button.) These buttons are in an orange box. The orange stands out from the white background. </p>
			<p>We want to create a safe environment for our users. When opening every page, you see a big picture at first, which creates curiosity and interest. Everything that is written has a soft tone of voice with a feeling of a friend sharing stories. </p>

          <h4 class="greencolor">Testing Report</h4>
          <ul>
            <strong>Testing goals</strong> 
			<p>We hope with testing our website to find out if everything on our website all buttons work for our users and all important pages are easy to find. </p>
			<p>The following problems are solved with this website: making friends who also travel and have important information for our target audience on one platform. These problems have the following solutions. On the website, users have the ability to communicate with each other by commenting on each other's blog and adding each other as friends allowing them to chat with each other. Users can see the experiences of other travelers containing important information through blogs and videos. Campsite itself will also post information on the website to provide a reliable source of information.</p>
			<p>Finally, we want to learn whether our website is attractive to users and whether they will use it more often. </p>
            <strong>Testing methods</strong>, 
            <p>For our website we want four people to test our website, these participants fall in the age category of our target group which is 20 to 27 years old. For testing we will use the following materials: A laptop to test the website, a phone to test and a phone to record the test. The testing will be done on campus. two participants will be testing our webpage on a laptop size and two participants will be testing our webpage on a phone size.</p>  
			<p>For testing purposes, you will be asked to perform the following tasks:</p>
			 <li>Go to the Blog page and open a blog.</li>
			 <li>Log in to your account. </li>
			 <li>Search for a new route to Rome, Italy. </li>
			 <p>We will record the assignments. We will only give advice on the assignment if the participants do not know how to proceed.</p>
            
             <strong>Testing results</strong>
             <p>After testing our website on both laptop and phone we found the following:</p>
			 <li>If the user wanted to click on something, they wanted to click on the whole picture instead of only the text. This would improve the UX, because now people think it isn’t a link.</li>
			 <li>Also it would have been nice if all/some of the buttons worked, or that you at least got a notification or something. </li>
			 <li>For the users, it was a bit unclear and confusing how and where to find new blogs. Because the text in the navigation bar says diaries and not blogs, people didn’t really expect that blogs would be in there.</li>
			<li>We found out that the navigation bar is not responsive to a smaller format like a phone. The search bar is overlapping the logo name. Which is confusing and weird for the users. </li>
			<li>For the users, it was easy to find new routes on the locations page. It was clear for them where to go and how it works.</li>

          <h4 class="greencolor">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p><strong>Target audience</strong> 
 <li>Who is your target group?</li>Camper van users between the ages of 20 - 27
 <li>What platforms do they use and how do they use it?</li>Both Instagram and Tiktok are popular apps within the vanlife community. We want to promote our platform by creating an online community. But also to be more interactive with our target group and give them a feeling of belonging within the community. We want to make them feel seen by us.  
<li>What details are important? </li>Our personna has a gap year, they are done with their studies and have worked for 1/ 2 years. They are not happy with their current situation and want to get to know themselves, and/or they want to travel the world before settling down.  
 <li>Target group</li>
 Camper van users between the ages of 20 - 27
 <li>What platforms and how?</li>Both Instagram and Tiktok are popular apps within the vanlife community. We want to promote our platform by creating an online community. But also to be more interactive with our target group and give them a feeling of belonging within the community. We want to make them feel seen by us.  
<li>Details</li>
Our personna has a gap year, they are done with their studies and have worked for 1/ 2 years. They are not happy with their current situation and want to get to know themselves, and/or they want to travel the world before settling down.  

One of the pains they have is they haven’t found themselves yet. Another pain point is that our personna has is that they have a lack of knowledge in traveling and don’t know other people with the same interests. 
 <li>Behavior?</li> Our target audience is  Adventurous and like to live in Low maintenance. They are social and like to get to know new people.  They like their freedom and the making of memories. They want to get out of their bubble. 
 <p><strong>Communication objectives</strong></p> 
<li>Communication objectives</li> 
 With our website we want to be able to built a community, sharing knowledge
<li>Reach objective </li> Since we just started our accounts we are not aiming for a too high of a reach. For instagram we want to reach around 200 people. We calculate this via the statistic called ‘’reach’’ on instagram itself. For tiktok we calculate our reach via people that watch the whole video. We think this will be around 250 people.
<li>Affect</li> We want our target audience to feel connected and they have a place to go and gain new information. On our platform, we will show them travel places, tips and tricks. This is like a preview of our platform. 
Response (what do you want the target audience to do?) Share new information for good preparation but also, they should share new info during or after

<p><strong>Media Tactics </strong></p> 
Most effective Social media platforms we can use to build our platform according to (ZIGT, 2023)
<li>Instagram: Around 85% of people between 20-27 years old use this </li>
<li>Tiktok: This is a fast growing platform, and within our target audience the popularity is very high</li>



<p><strong>Planning </strong></p> 
Instagram: we want to post every other day. According to Sheikh and Sheikh, 2024 it is most optimal to post 3/4 times a week.
<li>How? Via mostly reels, also pictures and stories. Either generated by ai, from the people we interviewed, and our own pictures.</li>
Tiktok: We want to post every other day on tiktok as well, for the same reason as insta to get into the algorithm.
<li>How? These tiktoks will be "trend hopping'' tiktoks and inspirational tiktoks. 
(For tiktok we want to hop on trend, and because of this, we cannot plan too much in advance)</li>
.</p>
		  <h4 class="greencolor">Social Media Identity</h4>
          <p>With our tiktok and instagram accounts we want to promote the website, create a community and drive traffic to the website. We want to do this by uploading videos, photos, and instagram stories. Our brand is about sharing experiences, knowledge, and having a community while being on the road.
</p>
		  <h4 class="greencolor">Reach</h4>
          <p>Our Instagram account has gathered 37 followers and has reached accounts  438
For our TikTok account we were able to get 20 followers and reach 413 accounts  (± 836 views for a slideshow post that cannot show if people watched it fully or not). Due to the fact that it is hard to see exactly who watched a video and who did not, perhaps the likes (362) can provide some extra context to how much interaction there was on our videos.
</p>

          <h4 class="greencolor">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>What we had learned after some feedback was that it was important to talk more about our website from the start, because we started more with tips, aesthetic posts and trend hopping without much context on who we were as a brand.
What we did not expect was the amount of accounts reached. With Instagram having over double the amount of reach we expected. however we did expect that the followers would not be too high, which is the case with both the instagram and tiktok accounts having less than 40 followers. We also thought it would be harder to create content for a website that does not exist, and that none of us had a campervan to use for content. But by thinking creatively we think we made it work and were able to create more content than expected. 
A part of our strategy was creating a community online, giving the website and socials an overarching sense of belonging and community. However this was very hard to realize considering the low number of followers. This could also be seen in our objective about response, where we hoped people would share tips and experiences. This did not really happen, but that is also understandable considering how new the platform was. Looking back, it could have benefitted us to follow some campervan and van life accounts to perhaps boost and broaden our reach.
</p>	
          <h4 class="greencolor">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>If we had more time we would be able to post more and plan the future posts ahead better. We would also have the time to create more skits and collaborations with other campervan accounts. It would also give us the opportunity to connect more with the community. It would also give us the time to grow our following, and due to the fact that we have less than 100 followers we could not see more info on who our target audiences are. If we were able to grow to over a hundred followers we could use the accessed information to cater our posts more specifically to them.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>We are solving the lack of community and experience before and during traveling with a camper vans.</strong></li>
			  <p>The interviews we did revealed that making friends while traveling is a problem and finding a friend to travel with is also a difficult issue.
By traveling with a camper there are fewer opportunities to meet other travelers, often as a traveler you are then more on your own or with the company you are traveling with. There are also a limited number of social spaces where campers can stand where there are also other people camping with RVs this also makes it harder to meet people who are also traveling with an RV.
What is a problem in being able to travel with friends is that people have different travel schedules. Some young people have different destinations or want to travel at a different time in their lives. This may also have to do with work. Furthermore, traveling together is also sometimes difficult because of a language barrier or cultural differences.</p>

            <li><strong>Our customers rely on reliable information</strong></li>It became clear during the interviews that it is difficult for young people traveling by campervan to find information. The interviewees themselves indicate that because they are still young, they have less experience in RV travel and travel in general. They also indicate that they learned a lot from their parents or friends. When the RV travelers look for information online they indicate that there is a plethora of information making it very difficult for them to know what the right information is and what they can use. Furthermore, the information is not always specific enough and geared toward older campers. Finally, young campers keep up with the news poorly so they are not always aware of new regulations in another country that are important for their trip.
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>We address the needs of the users by creating a community on our website. People can chat, share experiences, and help each other.</strong></li>
To solve both problems, we have created a platform. On this platform, young campers can share their adventures or make new friends and find more information relevant to their lifestyle. By doing this, we also hope to give our target group a chance to learn from each other and thus become a little more experienced when traveling. The website will do this by giving the opportunity for campers to share their stories through blogs or videos and follow that of others, as well as being able to comment on other blogs or videos, creating a community, helping each other. Furthermore, there will also be possibility to see in the website the trips of your friends and also meet people who make the same trips as our user. This will provide more opportunities to travel together or make friends while traveling.

          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>20-27 Year olds Gap year Low maintenance Adventures Curious</strong></li>
            Our target group involves young people between the ages of 20 and 27. They are young adults who love nature and travel and adventure. They are travelers who are curious about other cultures and eager to learn a lot about not only themselves, but about the world. They are often young adults who are having a gap year from college or who have worked for a few years and then want to travel. These young travelers are also people who don't need much to be happy and care a lot about luxury.

          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Info is being kept up to date by reviews from other users Young camper van traveller-oriented communication platform Sharing of knowledge, tips, tricks, and experiences Seeing journeys other people have been on Seeing your previous journeys Marking locations users want to go to</li>
            
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Person-to-person interaction website users keep the website up to date with new information about locations word-to-mouthpromotion through and during travelling</strong></li>An unfair advantage that campsite has compared to other companies is that we as a company get information directly from our target audience so we as a company understand our target audience better than our competitors. Another advantage is that the website is kept up to date by the users of the website. This happens until the users themselves post new sites, information and content. For example, they could post trends that are interesting at that time thus keeping the website up to date. Furthermore, travelers who use the app will recommend it to other travelers, so there will be a lot of word of mouth. Which will give us as a company free promotion.
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The company uses Instagram because our target group are Gen Z and are actively using this platform</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The company uses TikTok because our target group gen uses this platform and TikTok is a platform that rises in users from our target group.</strong></li>We use Instagram and TikTok as channels because our target audience is Gen Z and research shows that. "Looking at social media usage among Gen Z, the grbuik of Instagram is up (80%). The rising star among Generation Z is TikTok. TikTok is being used by at least half of Z people for the first time." (William and William, 2024)
Gen Z is primarily on Instagram and TikTok. If you do further research on young adults who are camping it is agreed on the channels that they are on these platforms. This is because accounts, videos and posts can be found of young adults sharing their camping life with the camper.

          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
