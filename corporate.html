              Our Visual identity fits with our vision and values because the colours we used are very calm, because we use warm nature tones. This can be linked to a safe environment. We want our users to feel comfortable enough to share their experiences. A calming colour pallet can help with this. Since the target audience enjoys camping and the outdoors, and the colour scheme matches their aesthetic, the colours also work for them. 
              
              <ul class="list-unstyled">

            <li>The typography aligns with our vision and values because a blog allows people to share knowledge and experiences, but without a clear font, readers won't understand what you are writing about. Furthermore, the typography has a handwritten appearance, which improves and personalises the blog reading experience. Because of this, it appeals to our target audience. </li>

                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>marketing and communication strategy</strong>?</li>

          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p><strong>Target audience</strong> 
 <li>Who is your target group?</li>Camper van users between the ages of 20 - 26
 <li>What platforms do they use and how do they use it?</li>Both Instagram and Tiktok are popular apps within the vanlife community. We want to promote our platform by creating an online community. But also to be more interactive with our target group and give them a feeling of belonging within the community. We want to make them feel seen by us.  
<li>What details are important? </li>Our personna has a gap year, they are done with their studies and have worked for 1/ 2 years. They are not happy with their current situation and want to get to know themselves, and/or they want to travel the world before settling down.  
One of the pains they have is they haven’t found themselves yet. Another pain point is that our personna has is that they have a lack of knowledge in traveling and don’t know other people with the same interests. 
 <li>What is their behavior?</li> Our target audience is  Adventurous and like to live in Low maintenance. They are social and like to get to know new people.  They like their freedom and the making of memories. They want to get out of their bubble. 
 <p><strong>Communication objectives</strong></p> 
<li>What communication objectives will you achieve?</li> 
 With our website we want to be able to built a community, sharing knowledge
<li>Reach objective </li> Since we just started our accounts we are not aiming for a too high of a reach. For instagram we want to reach around 200 people. We calculate this via the statistic called ‘’reach’’ on instagram itself. For tiktok we calculate our reach via people that watch the whole video. We think this will be around 250 people.
<li>Affect</li> We want our target audience to feel connected and they have a place to go and gain new information. On our platform, we will show them travel places, tips and tricks. This is like a preview of our platform. 
Response (what do you want the target audience to do?) Share new information for good preparation but also, they should share new info during or after

<p><strong>Media Tactics </strong></p> 
Most effective Social media platforms we can use to build our platform according to (ZIGT, 2023)
<li>Instagram: Around 85% of people between 20-27 years old use this </li>
<li>Tiktok: This is a fast growing platform, and within our target audience the popularity is very high</li>



<p><strong>Planning </strong></p> 
Instagram: we want to post every other day. According to Sheikh and Sheikh, 2024 it is most optimal to post 3/4 times a week.
<li>How? Via mostly reels, also pictures and stories. Either generated by ai, from the people we interviewed, and our own pictures.</li>
Tiktok: We want to post every other day on tiktok as well, for the same reason as insta to get into the algorithm.
<li>How? These tiktoks will be "trend hopping'' tiktoks and inspirational tiktoks. 
(For tiktok we want to hop on trend, and because of this, we cannot plan too much in advance)</li>
.</p>
          
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>What we had learned after some feedback was that it was important to talk more about our website from the start, because we started more with tips, aesthetic posts and trend hopping without much context on who we were as a brand.
What we did not expect was the amount of accounts reached. With Instagram having over double the amount of reach we expected. however we did expect that the followers would be too high, which is the case with both the instagram and tiktok accounts having less than 40 followers. We also thought it would be harder to create content for a website that does not exist, and that none of us had a campervan to use for content. But by thinking creatively we think we made it work and were able to create more content than expected. 
A part of our strategy was creating a community online, giving the website and socials an overarching sense of belonging and community. However this was very hard to realize considering the low number of followers. This could also be seen in our objective about response, where we hoped people would share tips and experiences. This did not really happen, but that is also understandable considering how new the platform was. Looking back, it could have benefitted us to follow some campervan and van life accounts to perhaps boost and broaden our reach.
</p>	
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>If we had more time we would be able to post more and plan the future posts ahead better. It would also give us the opportunity to connect more with the community. It would also give us the time to grow our following due to the fact that we have less than 100 followers and we could not see more info on who our target audiences are. If we were able to grow to over a hundred followers we could use the accessed information to cater our posts more specifically to them.</p>
