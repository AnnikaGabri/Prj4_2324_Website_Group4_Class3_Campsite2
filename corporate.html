          <ul>
            <li>
              Our Visual identity fits with our vision and values because the colours we used are very calm, because we use warm nature tones. This can be linked to a safe environment. We want our users to feel comfortable enough to share their experiences. A calming colour pallet can help with this. Since the target audience enjoys camping and the outdoors, and the colour scheme matches their aesthetic, the colours also work for them. 
              
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #E09132;"></span>
                  #E09132
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #454230;"></span>
                  #454230
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The typography aligns with our vision and values because a blog allows people to share knowledge and experiences, but without a clear font, readers won't understand what you are writing about. Furthermore, the typography has a handwritten appearance, which improves and personalises the blog reading experience. Because of this, it appeals to our target audience. </li>
			<li>We want to give our community a cosy vibe with the future designs and aesthetics of our website. This has the potential to foster a sense of belonging and unity. And therefore aligns with our vision of coming together. The cosy vibe that comes with camping makes this aesthetic appealing to our target market as well. </li>
            <li>UI and UX</li>
			<p>When opening the website, the first thing you see is a big video and the navigation bar of course. The nav bar has a few functions on the website. When clicking on the name ‘campsite’ you always go to the home page. Because people don’t always know that, we wanted to make the UX easier to make a ‘home’ page with one of the headers as well. The pages are listed next to each other and it's clear there are 4 main pages since there is not more text. We decided to make use of text instead of icons, so it's clear in 1 word what the page is about which we cannot express in 1 icon in our case. 
The left side of the navigation bar has 2 functions. You have a search bar and next to that a chat function. We wanted to put this in the nav bar so the chat function is always accessible. 
</p>
			<p>On the whole website, we use a lot of videos and pictures. Our target group is 20-26, this target group is a lot on Tiktkok and Instagram. So everything has to be clear with one glance.  When you hover over for example a video, it starts playing, which increases the UI. When you hover over an image or for example a blog, a slight shadow appears, so that it's clear when you click on it, it will lead you to something else.</p>
			<p>On top of that, throughout the website we made use of different buttons. (fe. the search button and the login button.) These buttons are in an orange box. The orange stands out from the white background. </p>
			<p>We want to create a safe environment for our users. When opening every page, you see a big picture at first, which creates curiosity and interest. Everything that is written has a soft tone of voice with a feeling of a friend sharing stories. </p>

          <h4 class="greencolor">Testing Report</h4>
          <ul>
            <strong>Testing goals</strong> 
			<p>We hope with testing our website to find out if everything on our website all buttons work for our users and all important pages are easy to find. </p>
			<p>The following problems are solved with this website: making friends who also travel and have important information for our target audience on one platform. These problems have the following solutions. On the website, users have the ability to communicate with each other by commenting on each other's blog and adding each other as friends allowing them to chat with each other. Users can see the experiences of other travelers containing important information through blogs and videos. Campsite itself will also post information on the website to provide a reliable source of information.</p>
			<p>Finally, we want to learn whether our website is attractive to users and whether they will use it more often. </p>
            <strong>Testing methods</strong>, 
            <p>For our website we want four people to test our website, these participants fall in the age category of our target group which is 20 to 27 years old. For testing we will use the following materials: A laptop to test the website, a phone to test and a phone to record the test. The testing will be done on campus. two participants will be testing our webpage on a laptop size and two participants will be testing our webpage on a phone size.</p>  
			<p>For testing purposes, you will be asked to perform the following tasks:</p>
			 <li>Go to the Blog page and open a blog.</li>
			 <li>Log in to your account. </li>
			 <li>Search for a new route to Rome, Italy. </li>
			 <p>We will record the assignments. We will only give advice on the assignment if the participants do not know how to proceed.</p>
            
             <strong>Testing results</strong>
             <p>After testing our website on both laptop and phone we found the following:</p>
			 <li>If the user wanted to click on something, they wanted to click on the whole picture instead of only the text. This would improve the UX, because now people think it isn’t a link.</li>
			 <li>Also it would have been nice if all/some of the buttons worked, or that you at least got a notification or something. </li>
			 <li>For the users, it was a bit unclear and confusing how and where to find new blogs. Because the text in the navigation bar says diaries and not blogs, people didn’t really expect that blogs would be in there.</li>
			<li>We found out that the navigation bar is not responsive to a smaller format like a phone. The search bar is overlapping the logo name. Which is confusing and weird for the users. </li>
			<li>For the users, it was easy to find new routes on the locations page. It was clear for them where to go and how it works.</li>

          <h4 class="greencolor">Context of campaign</h4>
          
 <ul> What content should we post?
  According to Choi et al. (2023), Generation Z travellers would use the Instagram marketplace. The target group would have confidence in the marketplace and be positively influenced to buy products and services from sellers. They would trust sellers when interacting. This indicates that our target audience is interested in buying stuff. Services to buy from the Instagram Marketplace and thus they are highly engaged there. We could take advantage of this by using Marketplace itself or posting something on it. Or information about sales. Sellers or being able to give tips on our own Instagram account.
  According to Ramgade and Kumar (2021), Gen Z is still growing in economic strength, but one thing that is very profound about this generation is that they are very aware of environmental issues and their effects and are thus more concerned about ecological balance. Furthermore, the target group finds it very important to have eco-friendly options while travelling. These travellers are looking for sustainable authentic experiences. Therefore, it is important to use our social media platforms to discuss the most eco-friendly or ecological tips or products. From Google's report (Gen Z Trends & Insights, 2021). Turns out the trend among generation Z. is the following. They have an effort arc of 0.8 seconds. They please see everything through video 's. See themselves as authentic. Further. Believe that companies should prove themselves by doing rather than talking. These following points indicate that as a company, we should mainly use videos to capture the attention of this generation. That our videos can never be longer than 0.8 seconds or that within the few seconds that We have we should grab attention right away. Furthermore, we need to be as. Company Showing. Do things like that instead of mainly saying it, so posting. Actions would. Have a positive effect on this generation.Travelers are actively seeking and choosing destinations that offer a more authentic and immersive travel experience. It’s no surprise that up to 41% of travellers are actively seeking smaller, lesser-known destinations. Says Mirko Lalli, (2024). This would mean that in our posting on social media, we should take into account that we post places and activities that are a little less. Popular and a little less frequented. That way, you get the authentic and the special. What our target audience is looking for.
  
  <p>What suits our company and what do other companies post?
  The fact that young people have been traveling more and more in recent times has not gone unnoticed. Goboony has seen a significant increase in bookings (De Graaf, 2023 ). In one year, the number of campervan rentals has increased by almost 30 percent. Goboony is a Dutch company that rents out campers on their website, it is like Airbnb for the campers. They also have an active Instagram account where they share travel ideas and promote their company (Instagram, n.d.). What is also part of this is the following. Generation Z is increasingly aware of sustainability and the environment. They are increasingly aware of what their actions now have on their future (Prayag et al., 2022). This also affects destination marketing, where places (cities and countries) have to position themselves differently and how they have to brand themselves to tourists (Kolb, 2017).</p>
  
  <p>Campsite definitely sees Goboony as an example for our own Instagram. What Goboony does very well is targeting the consumer. They show a lot of destinations and places for inspiration. Research has also shown this. It shows that social media is more effective than ‘traditional’ marketing. It also has a positive impact on things like brand loyalty and brand awareness (Ninan, Roy, & Cheriyan, 2020).</p>

  <p> Another Instagram account that does this very well is ‘theggoldenroad’. This account explains a lot and very well what the camper life looks like and how they experience it. They also really try to convince people to also start living this camper life (Instagram, n.d. -b).
  Camper_4_ever is a German account, so we can not understand everything. But when you look at their feed, the right side is full of quotes. Viswanathan (2022) also talks about this, ‘you set up a long term relationship. They might share the link to your profile and feed to others, spreading the word about your account’. Once you look at the likes and comments, these posts do significantly better than the rest of their posts.  But what they also do very well, and what we as Campsite can also do better, is give a lot of tips for camper life. This account is really like a kind of diary of her travels for her (Instagram, n.d. -c).
  This campaign is focussed on Gen Z because this group finds it very important and highly values eco-friendly options while traveling. Also, this generation is also looking for other brands that align with their standards and values ​​and their concerns about the environment (Ramgade and Kumar, 2021). On top of that, the Gen Z generation is willing to spend more money when something is a more eco-friendly choice (Shaw, 2024). </p>
  
        <h4 class="greencolor">Sustainability Campaign</h4>

 <p>Campsite’s goal is to attract visitors to our website, create a community online, and inspire our audience to travel as environmentally friendly as possible. This last point will also be one of our main components to our new campaign. Being a sustainable trendsetter is a powerful way to appeal to consumers and boost brand image (Feria, 2023). Sustainability marketing campaigns have emerged as powerful tools for brands to drive positive change, raise awareness about critical issues, and inspire consumers to take action (Levytskyi, 2024). A successful green marketing campaign seamlessly incorporates environmental responsibility with strategic marketing. Some of the main factors that contribute to its success include authenticity, clear and measurable goals, consumer engagement, value alignment, innovative communication, leveraging data, and measuring impact (Prakash, 2024).
  This campaign will be titled; Adventures with purpose. The title of the campaign, Adventures with purpose, has a double meaning. First of all, we want people to have a purpose on their travels, in this case traveling as environmentally friendly as possible. In addition, we want your travels aiming to connect. Connecting with each other, but mainly connecting with our website of course. With this campaign we want to show campervan users how they can make a difference, letting our audience to think about their lifestyle and how they can give back to nature while being surrounded by it. For example, each year the European Commission awards the European Green capital awards (Winning cities, n.d.). Stimulating traveling to these cities is just one example. A study done by Unilever showed that 75% of people polled are more likely to take up behaviors to help save the planet after watching social media content about sustainability (Unilever, 2023). During this campaign we will post a variety of posts. Something specific things we aim to do is the following. Earlier we saw that the instagram account Camper_4_ever covered the right side of their feed with quotes. These quotes did significantly better than the rest of the posts. Creating consistency is especially important for our instagram account (Mathur, 2024). Like Viswanathan (2022) said before, this consistency creates a long term relationship with your account and followers. And spread the word about your account. Especially with a travel account this is important since we aim to connect with our followers but also our followers with each other. 
  We want to keep giving them tips about how they can travel as environmentally friendly as possible, like activities they can do. To make sure travelers connect on the road, we want to have some calls of actions. For example, we can encourage our followers to meet up to exchange clothes or books. Or they go to the beach together to make necklaces from shells. 
  We will be using both Tiktok and Instagram since on TikTok, the #vanlife hashtag has been viewed more than 12 billion times, while Instagram returns upwards of 15 million posts (Prendergast, 2024). We will be posting 3 times per week on tiktok and 4 times a week on Instagram. It's usually advised to begin posting on TikTok three or four times a week. You can increase the frequency as you become more at ease and gain a deeper understanding of your audience. On TikTok, regular posting keeps your audience interested and can increase your visibility (Supliful, 2024). For brands, the aim is to post three to five times a week for their main Instagram feed. But keep in mind that sharing fewer excellent posts is preferable to sharing a lot of low-quality content because quality should always come first. Just make an effort to post frequently and steadily over time (Team, 2024). 
  We also created a justification list per post, this can be found in the appendix. </p>
  
<h4 class="greencolor">Frequency of posting</h4>

 <p>Now we know that Instagram and Tiktok are good platforms to use for our social media campaigns. How many times should we be posting on those platforms?
    According to Vizart,et.all there is not an ideal strategy when it comes to posting. However there are key considerations that we can keep in mind. 
    For brands, the aim is to post three to five times a week for their main Instagram feed. But keep in mind that sharing fewer excellent posts is preferable to sharing a lot of low-quality content because quality should always come first. Just make an effort to post frequently and steadily over time (Team, 2024). Because of this research, we are going to post 4 times a week.  
    Let's move on to timing, because when is the best time to post on Instagram? 
    Once more, there is no one-size-fits-all method for the best outcomes when it comes to timing (Mathur, 2024). But you can position yourself for success by adhering to a few general guidelines.
  </p>
  <p> First, consider your audience's everyday routines. Are young professionals your target audience? These people are more likely to work a standard 9–5 schedule with a midday lunch break. Here, posting content a little before lunch is a great move. However, posting between 7 and 9 pm guarantees that, if you are targeting busy new mothers, people will see your content during those valuable hours when the baby is sleeping.
    Secondly, keep in mind that the weekend posting schedule should be different because people tend to have more time. The hours between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays are typically when Instagram usage peaks.
    The best option is to monitor your audience behavior for some time and find out at what times or what days you will have the most engagement (Team, 2024). 
  </p>
  <p> For Tiktok
    It's usually advised to begin posting on TikTok three or four times a week. You can increase the frequency as you become more at ease and gain a deeper understanding of your audience. On TikTok, regular posting keeps your audience interested and can increase your visibility. Therefore, consistency is essential. A variety of elements, like sharing pertinent, interesting, and high-quality content, influence the final outcome when posting. Even with the ideal posting frequency, you won't get the results you want with lower-quality content.The visibility of your post is also influenced by the way your audience engages with the content (likes, comments, and shares) and its features (audio, video, captions, and hashtags) (Supliful, 2024). 
    Because of this research we aim to post three times a week on Tiktok. </p>  
    
  <p> What time should we post on tiktok? 
    Not surprisingly, the majority of TikTok users use the app most during their free time, which is typically later in the day.
    </p> 
 <p> As per Macready (2024) the optimal periods for posting on tiktok are:
    </li>Monday, 3 PM
    </li>Tuesday from 3 to 5PM
    </li>Wednesday, 3PM
    </li>Thursday: 3PM 
    </li>Friday: 12 PM
 This is when most users are active on Tiktok. 
The data also indicated that businesses should avoid posting on TikTok during the weekends.

<h4 class="greencolor"> objectives</h4>
<h4 class="greencolor"> Reach</h4>
  <b>By the 28th of December we want to reach 50 people on Instagram and  24 people on Tiktok. 
  </b>

<P>We want to use social media to reach a wider audience. We think it is very important to use social media platforms because the younger generation is mainly active there. Research shows that this generation spends an average of 4 hours a day on their mobile phones. Thus, 18% of young people spend an average of 3 hours a day on social media, 17% two hours, 6% one hour, and less than 3% less than one hour a day (Smiley, 2024). This clearly indicates that a media campaign on social media is the best way to reach our target audience. Through advertising and campaigns, we can direct our target audience to the website. An additional advantage of social media is that you can link posts directly to a website, directing users straight to the desired page. 
</P>
<P>Let's move on to the reasons we believe we can reach 50 people on Instagram. First off, a number of elements, including the calibre of the material and the use of hashtags, will determine how many people you reach. In the first month, new Instagram profiles can anticipate reaching hundreds to a few thousand users, according to Profile Views On (z.d.). When considering our past efforts, this looked like much too much for our brand. Our first campaign reached 39 users. In light of our source and our belief that we can outperform our initial campaign, we have now selected 50 individuals. 
We aim to reach 24 people on Tiktok. Since we had trouble connecting with our audience during our previous Tiktok social media campaign, we decided to go with a reduced reach for this platform. Since there are so many other videos waiting for the viewer to see, it is quite simple for viewers to simply scroll past your video if it doesn't grab their attention right away because the platform is made up of short form material (Montenegro, 2022). Because of this, we decided to use tiktok to contact just 24 individuals. 
</P>
<P>We want to reach this objective by posting consistently, we will post seven times a week four times on Instagram and three times on Tiktok. Next, we will be using trending hashtags that fit with our audience such as #vanlife #campsite and #Sustainability. Additionally, we will make sure that our videos will have high quality. We do this by using Canva for each post and uploading the posts in 4k. And lastly, we will add a fitting caption to each post. 
</P>
<h4 class="greencolor"> Affect</h4>
  <b>By the end of our campaign, we hope that the viewers will acquire a feeling of community and connection to our brand. Our viewers should also be more cognisant of and responsible for the environment.  
  </b>
<P>We will start by analyzing the audience's responses to our campaign. After the start of our campaign, we want the viewers to feel curious. We also want them to feel like they belong in our community. According to Miethlich and Oldenburg (2019) A company's principles can be made more evident through social inclusion, which is an intriguing potential that helps build a strong brand and enhances reputation. 
  We desire our audience to be proud of their environmental impact. The behavioral changes of our audience will be discussed next. We anticipate a rise in audience participation in events. We hope that they will be engaged on the website and social media. And lastly will this change our audience's quality of life? We hope that our audience will have enhanced life satisfaction, because they can talk about their travels in our community and feel good about being environmentally friendly. 
</P>
  <h4 class="greencolor"> Response</h4>
    <b>We want to increase followers on our social media among young campervan travelers by reaching a total of 27 more followers on TikTok and Instagram combined by the 28th of December. 
    </b>
  <P>For our communication objective, we looked at the results we have achieved on these platforms before. We think it is possible to achieve 50% of the result achieved last time. For Instagram, this means 19 extra followers for instagram and for TikTok 8 extra followers. We choose to set this target because we have noticed that the number of new followers decreases over time.
  </P>
<P>Why we want to use social media is because our target audience can be found on social media. According to Jackson (2024), generation Z, our target audience's generation would largely spend their time on social media channels Instagram and TikTok. For instance, the generation would spend an average of 1 hour a day on TikTok and an average of 36 minutes on Instagram (Smiley, 2024). This indicates that it is important for us as a company to also advertise our website on these platforms and that this is the best way to reach our target audience.
</P>
<ul><b>Previous campaigns</b>
<p>In the first campaign we engaged with 39 accounts on Tiktok and Instagram. By the time this campaign ended, we could tell that our target market was using Instagram more frequently than Tiktok. This was because we had a large number of views (2,213). But there are only 88 likes. We felt that this was sufficient justification to limit the second campaign's focus to Instagram. We only interacted with 14 accounts, so the campaign's final results revealed a different picture. In the conclusion of this campaign we said that ‘’Having advertisement type of content helps with brand awareness while trend hopping allows for more interaction. So finding the balance in both styles could be a sweet spot to be at,and looking at hindsight it would be something we could have done instead.’’
</p>
<ul><b>This campaign</b>
<p>We want to use Instagram and Tiktok for this campaign because, as previously mentioned, we have experience with working with them. However, we also want to use both platforms because: 
</p>
<p>Instagram is one of the most used social media platforms. This is why:
The number of monthly active users is 2 billion
The largest age group is 18-24 (30.8%). This is the age of our target audience
Average time spent per day: 33.1 minutes (per person)

On top of that the platform’s growth remains steady in spite of a slowdown in recent years.
As far as social media age demographics go, Instagram maintains a firm hold on both Gen Z and millennials. These groups make up roughly two-thirds of their base.
Time spent on the platform increased from the previous year’s 30.1 minutes. A 2-minute increase indicates that people are spending more time engaging with Instagram content (Zote, 2024).
</p>
<p>Now for Tiktok. TikTok is the fastest growing platform. Here are their statistics: 
Number of monthly active users is 1.7 billion
Largest age group: 18-24 (36.2%). Our target audience’s age. 
Gender distribution: 49.2% female, 50.8% male (no data on other genders)
Average time spent per day: 53.8 minutes (per person) 
</p>
Takeaways from TikTok demographics for 2024
TikTok hasn’t surpassed Facebook and Instagram in number of monthly active users. But its growing popularity and increased usage could soon change that.
Gen Z is driving this growth in popularity, with 78% of US Gen Z using it in 2023.
Not only is TikTok’s user base booming but also its daily activity. TikTok boasts the highest average time spent per day of any network. Daily time spent on the platform grew by almost 10 minutes compared to the previous year’s 45.8 minutes (Zote, 2024).
And lastly, the #vanlife dominates TikTok and Instagram as audiences are eager to watch these social media nomads go about their excursions. Videos of camper conversions and migratory daily routines attract just as many likes as the sweeping landscapes and breathtaking horizons (Murray, 2021). The hashtag has been viewed more than 12 billion times, while Instagram returns upwards of 15 million posts (Prendergast, 2024).
         
<h4 class="greencolor">Learning points&nbsp;</h4>
          <ul><b>What did we learn during the duration of the project concerning the campaign? </b>
            <p>For this campaign, we conducted extensive research into the interests and needs of our target group, Gen-Z travelers. For this research, we focused primarily on their social media use and their travel needs. The goal of this research was to gain a good understanding of what kind of content appeals to them, what interests them, what motivates them and how their social media use relates to their travel needs. This research helped us a lot to gain better insights into our target group and we were able to anticipate this for our social media posts.
              But what we also learned is that no matter how much research you do, in practice it can always turn out differently. Although we did a lot of research, we came away with new insights after the campaign. We will explain in detail how it turned out differently later in the Learning Points.
              In addition, we learned the following. What we noticed with both our Instagram and TikTok posts was that the majority of the views and interactions came from accounts that already followed us. Reaching new accounts and potential new followers turned out to be more difficult than we had anticipated beforehand. Despite the fact that we tried to create content that really appealed to our target audience, it was still difficult to really make ourselves known to non-followers. This has taught us, among other things, that not only good content is crucial in the campaign. But also the moment of posting, how often you should post etc., all play an important role in your reach to new audiences.
              Also, we created and prepared all our content in advance, before we even started posting. We based this content on research and we actually assumed that this would work and appeal to new followers. On the contrary, that didn't work out completely. Something we learned is that it is also important to keep a close eye on your statistics during your campaign. Because during your campaign you can still anticipate what is happening at that moment and still change things for further posting. Although we didn't do this, it is certainly good to take this into account in the future.
            </p>   
<ul></ul>
              <ul><b>What worked and what didn’t? </b>
                <p>We used more consistency in this campaign. The most important thing was our message to travel more environmentally friendly with a camper. In many of our posts we tried to convey this message. Information and tips were given throughout the campaign. 
                  What is shown in the image here is the following. Everything that has a red circle around it has to do with tips about traveling or sustainable travel. What is striking is that these posts have more views than other types of posts.
                  What you see with both our insta and Tiktok posts is that on average a video is watched for about 5 seconds. What we have already researched is that the first 0.8 seconds of a video is the most important.
                </p>
                  <ul><b>What went as expected and what didn’t? </b>
                 <p></p>
        <ul><b>Reach objective </b>
                    <p>What went according to expectations is that we would get fewer views for posting photos than for videos. What we did not expect is that, compared to the last time we posted, we would have fewer views. What we also didn't expect is that the strategy we used last time, namely trend hopping, works better than our new tactic where we take a topic and focus more on providing useful information.
                      Thus, it can be seen that the reach of not only videos but also photos was high last time we did this assignment. However, we do see that with our new strategy, our own followers view our posts more than non-followers, which was the other way around before.
                      Our overall information for instagram, we achieved to have more than 100 new likes. In addition, we got 50 profile views. Looking at the overall information from TikTok, we see that for likes, we have 68 and for profile views, we have only 19. We had expected to come close to these amounts of likes and profile views. We do see the numbers as positive, but it gives us room for improvement.
                    </p>   
        <ul><b>Objective feeling </b>
                      <p>Looking at our goal of creating viewer curiosity, we did not expect that we would not be able to convey this feeling. By the numbers, we know that our content is mainly viewed by our followers and not by new people, indicating that we are not generating curiosity among new followers to also follow us and view our content. In other words, we are not doing this enough.</Ul>
                      </p>
                      <ul><b>Objective response </b>
                <P>Looking at our goals for response, we can conclude that we did not gain any new followers on Instagram in the time of posting, which we did not expect. This is because we were actually hoping to gain more followers with the content. On the contrary, we hoped that our content would be more interesting, which apparently is not the case after all. At TikTok, we only gained one extra follower. This indicates that our campaign, which was supposed to be based on the interests of our target audience, did not work. These interests of the target audience we researched are apparently not looked up on TikTok or Instagram.</P>
         <ul><b>What would we do differently? </b>   
          <p>Looking at the points we could do differently, the goals we had set for ourselves clearly tell us what we need to adjust for next time. Looking back at our campaign and posts, we forgot to apply our goal of creating a sense of curiosity in our viewers and followers when creating content, or did not apply it enough. Many of our posts are informative or focus on advertising our website. Because almost all posts are related to the nature-friendly theme, it might be that posting only posts in that theme may be to much and variety is much more important in posting next time. So different kinds of interests, not just tips, but also just trendy things without a particular thought, like passing on information, but what might be meant to be more comical. To create better content we should according to Dwivedi (2024) take the time to read competitor blogs and analyse their social media content. See how they approach potential customers with their online and social marketing strategies. This can help to get new ideas of content and what kind of posts are popular or not.</p> 
          <p>To get more engagement next time we should, according to Kenan and Kenan (2024), make more shareable content to get more engagement. Social media users like to share things that they like, respect, or think are useful, so produce and select content that will encourage your followers to click the "share" button. Like for example have at the end of a video or in a video a little text or somebody who ask to share the video.</p>
          <p>Also, for next time, We think we should post more videos instead of photos. Because these are always viewed more often, and also create more interaction. Furthermore, We also think that the community feel, which we are so keen to convey, can be done better by posting content from people who follow us or, on the contrary, become more interactive again by asking followers for feedback. Answering questions from followers or letting them do some kind of poll, making it feel more like a community than an account you can follow could increase the community feeling (Nicol, 2024). By using this way of communication or continuing to post in this way in the future, we can also get more engagement and therefore more followers on TikTok and Instagram. </p> 
          <p>On TikTok, you can also do this by making videos where you ask or answer questions specifically, from answers that we got from polls. We could perhaps answer the most common questions asked on Instagram, for example, or on the website itself. Furthermore, reposting TikToks from people in the community could also help reinforce that sense of community and feeling connected to each other.
          </p>

                <h4 class="greencolor">Future planning</h4>
          <p>Reflection on what we did and what we  would do differently. 
            For posting we focussed on traveling with Campsite. This entailed that we made posts about the options you can have if you decide to travel with Campsite. This varies from tips, tricks and news. We also made an example post of people who were traveling with Campsite and they took the viewers with them on their holiday. This post was called “pov: Summer in Portugal”. 
            Overall, we think that our post ideas were better than the previous campaign. However, for the future we want to interact more with our audience. We want to do this by letting the audience vote on questions to see if they are ready to go camping, testing their knowledge. This to create a better bond with our followers. 
            In total we made 8 posts, this is a good amount of posts considering the time that we had. However, in the future we would like to have more time to post. 
            Because when we would have had more time we could reach even more people, and create more brand awareness within our target audience. 
          </p>

            <p>As mentioned before, using Instagram was our top priority. Our plan was to share a post every other day, for 2 weeks. This went well, however there was one time that we forgot to post the planned day. We fixed this by posting a day later and then posting again the next day, as our planning would stay the same. Other than that, the posting went very well. 
            However, going forward, it would be a good idea to prepare our posts in advance and schedule them because Instagram will post them on your behalf at the time and date you designate it.</p>
          </p>
            

            <p>If we carry on with Campsite our team will create additional content mainly for the 
            reason to connect our community with each other. We will do this by creating; </p> 
          </p>
          
            <p>
            <li>Posts about trips users have been on to inspire others  </li>
            <li>Posts where we highlight the most outstanding diaries that have been written by our users, we would do this weekly. This will encourage our users to write public diaries more. </li>
            <li>Educational Instagram stories about the purpose and values of Campsite. These stories will be highlighted after they are posted. So that they will appear on our profile. We want to do this in order for people who are interested in our posts to have a clearer understanding of what Campsite is. Our goal with this is that they would join our community because they are interested in Campsite.</li>
            <li>Informational posts about camping, for example a packing list with stuff you should never forget when camping. We can also post these weekly. </li>
            <li>Aesthetically pleasing posts about how beautiful nature is. We want to do this to inspire others to go camping as well.</li>
            <li> Posts where the beauty of camping is shown for example; how cozy camping is, posts about people who made new friends, posts where people make memories, etc. We also want to post these weekly and we would use the content of our users.</li>
            <li> We would be posting four times a week. </li>
            <li> As mentioned earlier our goal with posting is to grow our community closer to each other. We hope to achieve this because our audience would weekly see a few posts of the community itself. This can encourage users to write or post themselves. On top of that, when a user sees a story they are interested in, they can even try to get in touch with the person that posted that diary, as the Campsite username of them will be shown in our post. </li>

          <h4 class="greencolor">Lean Canvas</h4>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>We are solving the lack of community and experience before and during traveling with a camper vans.</strong></li>
			  <p>The interviews we did revealed that making friends while traveling is a problem and finding a friend to travel with is also a difficult issue.
By traveling with a camper there are fewer opportunities to meet other travelers, often as a traveler you are then more on your own or with the company you are traveling with. There are also a limited number of social spaces where campers can stand where there are also other people camping with RVs this also makes it harder to meet people who are also traveling with an RV.
What is a problem in being able to travel with friends is that people have different travel schedules. Some young people have different destinations or want to travel at a different time in their lives. This may also have to do with work. Furthermore, traveling together is also sometimes difficult because of a language barrier or cultural differences.</p>

            <li><strong>Our customers rely on reliable information</strong></li>It became clear during the interviews that it is difficult for young people traveling by campervan to find information. The interviewees themselves indicate that because they are still young, they have less experience in RV travel and travel in general. They also indicate that they learned a lot from their parents or friends. When the RV travelers look for information online they indicate that there is a plethora of information making it very difficult for them to know what the right information is and what they can use. Furthermore, the information is not always specific enough and geared toward older campers. Finally, young campers keep up with the news poorly so they are not always aware of new regulations in another country that are important for their trip.
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>We address the needs of the users by creating a community on our website. People can chat, share experiences, and help each other.</strong></li>
To solve both problems, we have created a platform. On this platform, young campers can share their adventures or make new friends and find more information relevant to their lifestyle. By doing this, we also hope to give our target group a chance to learn from each other and thus become a little more experienced when traveling. The website will do this by giving the opportunity for campers to share their stories through blogs or videos and follow that of others, as well as being able to comment on other blogs or videos, creating a community, helping each other. Furthermore, there will also be possibility to see in the website the trips of your friends and also meet people who make the same trips as our user. This will provide more opportunities to travel together or make friends while traveling.

          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>20-27 Year olds Gap year Low maintenance Adventures Curious</strong></li>
            Our target group involves young people between the ages of 20 and 27. They are young adults who love nature and travel and adventure. They are travelers who are curious about other cultures and eager to learn a lot about not only themselves, but about the world. They are often young adults who are having a gap year from college or who have worked for a few years and then want to travel. These young travelers are also people who don't need much to be happy and care a lot about luxury.

          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Info is being kept up to date by reviews from other users Young camper van traveller-oriented communication platform Sharing of knowledge, tips, tricks, and experiences Seeing journeys other people have been on Seeing your previous journeys Marking locations users want to go to</li>
            
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Person-to-person interaction website users keep the website up to date with new information about locations word-to-mouthpromotion through and during travelling</strong></li>An unfair advantage that campsite has compared to other companies is that we as a company get information directly from our target audience so we as a company understand our target audience better than our competitors. Another advantage is that the website is kept up to date by the users of the website. This happens until the users themselves post new sites, information and content. For example, they could post trends that are interesting at that time thus keeping the website up to date.
